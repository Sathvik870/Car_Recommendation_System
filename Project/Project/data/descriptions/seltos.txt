Overview

The Seltos Turbo Petrol has been upgraded with a 100cc increase in engine size and 20 horsepower more, making it a great all-rounder with confidence and ease in its performance.

Design and Features

The X-Line variant has a matte paint effect, blacked-out chrome bits, and dual exhausts, giving it a stealthy look. The interior is premium, with a classy design, impressive materials, and a black and gray color combination. The feature list is richer, with dual zone climate control, ventilated seats, twin digital displays, and a Bose sound system.

Performance

The turbo petrol engine has a casual confidence, making it easy and enjoyable in slow city traffic. The acceleration is smooth and strong from low revs, and the engine is strong enough for everyday commuting. The new dual clutch gearbox is quick, smooth, and sophisticated, making it the benchmark in the segment.

Concerns

The fuel efficiency in the city is around 9 kmpl, and the brakes could have more power and immediacy. The suspension has improved but is still not as classy as the transformation under the hood.

Recommendation

If your focus is on city use, consider the lower part 1.5L petrol with the CBD automatic transmission, which is smooth, convenient, more efficient, and cheaper. If you're an enthusiast, the turbo petrol with the dual clutch gearbox is the default recommendation.

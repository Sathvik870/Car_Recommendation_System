Nissan X-Trail Review

The Nissan X-Trail is a car that has been launched in India with a price tag of around 40 lakhs. However, the car's specifications and features do not match up to its price. The car has a 1.5L 3-cylinder engine, a 5-speed CVT transmission, and a front-wheel drive system. The car's interior lacks premium features, and the third row of seats is not usable.

Disconnect between Nissan's aspirations and the car's features

Nissan wants to position itself as a premium brand in India, but the X-Trail's features do not match up to this aspiration. The car's engine, transmission, and interior features are not impressive, and the car's price is too high for what it offers.

Comparison with other cars in the market

The X-Trail's price puts it in competition with other cars like the Jeep Meridian and the Skoda Kodiak. However, these cars offer more features, better performance, and a more premium feel than the X-Trail.

Nissan's strategy and future plans

Nissan's strategy of launching the X-Trail as a halo car to promote its brand in India may not work. The company needs to focus on launching more products that are relevant to the Indian market and offer better value to customers. Nissan has showcased other vehicles, including an electric car, which may be launched in the next two years.

Suggestions for the Nissan Magnite facelift

The Nissan Magnite is a great car that needs some tweaks to make it more appealing to customers. The three critical changes that need to be made to the Magnite facelift are:

Fix the plastics inside the cabin, which are too rattly and look too cheap.
Improve the sound insulation, which is poor and makes the car feel cheap.
Fine-tune the suspension, especially with the turbo CVT, to make it softer and more practical.
Conclusion

The Nissan X-Trail is not a car that is worth considering at its current price. Nissan needs to focus on launching more products that offer better value to customers and match up to its aspirations as a premium brand. The Magnite facelift needs some tweaks to make it more appealing to customers.

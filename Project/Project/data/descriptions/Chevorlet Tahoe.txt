The Chevrolet Tahoe is a large, full-size SUV offering three rows of seating that can accommodate up to 8 passengers. With a powerful V8 engine, it’s great for long road trips, towing, and off-roading. While it’s not the most fuel-efficient, it makes up for it with spacious interiors and a smooth ride.
